# Clinic Management - Frontend

This is the frontend project for the Clinic Management platform, developed with **React** and **Vite**. The application features a complete landing page with information about services and specialists, as well as a dynamic and comprehensive user authentication system.

The Login/Registration system is the core of the application, featuring a multi-step **Stepper** component that intelligently guides the user through the flow of email verification, registration, login, and optional profile completion.

## Crucial Prerequisite: The Backend API

This is a **frontend-only** project. For the Login and Registration system to function, it is **essential** that the corresponding backend API is running locally on your machine.

The API is responsible for managing users, validating credentials, and storing data.

* **Link to the Backend Repository:** [**gestao-clinica-api**](https://github.com/FeCocco/gestao-clinica-api)

Please follow the instructions in the backend's `README.md` to clone, set up the database, and start the server (usually on `http://localhost:8080`).
